            &lt;h2 id=&quot;the-problem&quot;&gt;The Problem&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can’t be happy for your wedding. you just can’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-solution&quot;&gt;The Solution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“we don’t have family so this is our family”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;very recently before mentioning her mother passed away nonchalantly. 
by marriage or by chance. it’s a bit of a wild&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we were greeted by a list of rules and regulations and the stakes are high because we are on borrowed land and they were worried that their license might actually be revoked because they were causing quite a ruckus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i think arabs and pakistanis are loud by culture, is that racist to say? it’s not meant to be condescending but it’s just part of their culture. ???&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;i hated catch me if you can. there i said it. despite dicaprio’s charming blue eyes, and spielberg’s storytelling, and this somewhat witty character people can’t help but to fall in love, it brims me with anger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;first of all, a lot of this was a political statement. this was the 60’s, Nixon’s era. White supremacy is at its supreme. 60% of why frank got away with things were because he was white. that’s just part of the narrative that they forgot to mention. he was a white male in a pilot uniform. what can go wrong?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but you know what angered me the most was that he learnt scamming from his father. his dad who let him skip school so he could accompany him to the bank. it made it sound so important that he needed to harrass a clothing store employee to rent him a suit for his son that was totally unnecessary. his father lied through his teeth to get what he wants. and that set an example to frank jr. on how the world worked and that doesn’t sit well to me. that this 16 year old kid who felt that the mouse that churned butter meant scamming through the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you know why this angers me so much? the fact that he doesn’t even think of the consequence. of the money he laundered, of the lives he risked impersonating professions that deals with people’s lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this was nixon’s era, this was the start of the war on drugs. minority communities have been cirminalized and been sent to jail and this punk ass mo fo is getting away doing far worse a crime? forging checks and forging identities. throughout the movie we don’t see any blacks, except for this one poor kid who was in deep pain and his legs snapped to two (probably? idk the movie never properly diagnosed him apart from an intern’s unsure diagnosis) and his fate is left to this idiot who forged a harvard cert and medical education lmitied to medically inaccurate dramas in the 60’s I mean how unlucky can you be? That you’re in a life and death situation and your fate is in the hands of a freaking fraud? the movie didn’t show what happened to that kid but I am pretty sure that he died.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and this whole narrative of “oh dad i’ll get back the money you lost, i will avenge you.” like what money? the money he got from tax evasions? the money he got from lying and cheating? How entitled can you be that you felt that you are entitled for luxury. this is a problem with riches when they fall to rags, they have NO idea how to live an honest life as a middle to lower-class citizen. They have no idea the struggles of people trying to make an honest living, and I am suppoed to like this guy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;about: Interests: Lycanthropy, linguistics, true crime, pop culture &amp;amp; flipibits

Essay ideas&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japanese culture - body language, and cold shoulder, and passive aggression in a new level. it was hard to read social cues when they’re not being assholes. but even on a normal level, a little distress would give an idea of why something is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;sound symbolism in branding&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;debugging through the iron curtain. the mysteries of flip bits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the infuriating response of women to appease their perprator; aka chicken soup not for the soul&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;///&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I watched Mamma Mia for the first time and wow was I missing out on a masterpiece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t necessarily something I usually indulge in but it made me feel so happy. weirdly so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read an article on it on how https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/nov/27/women and it explained so much on how mamma mia was engineered to be a feel good movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for one thing, it didn’t over sexualize the female characters. Amanda Seyfried always was in a one-piece bathing suit and the other characters were so comfortable with their own promiscuity and it was catering towards the female gaze. it is the male charcters that look dumb and stupid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;It was very interesting to see the film get totally panned by male critics, but they just didn't understand it. In any other film, the 20-year-old female character would have been Pierce Brosnan's love interest, but in Mamma Mia! there's no hint of sexual tension between them. And when you know that's not going to happen, you relax.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it’s something so subconcious that i didn’t know it bothered me before, but having the cast presented in a way that was so young and wild and free. and meryl streep worked wonderously as someone embracing her youth embodied in a body her age. it felt so fresh. to see these three middle aged women just owning their bodies and freedom and being dancing queens prancing around chaing guys and being promiscuous with no judgement, but purely from their frivolity and not for the male gaze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;meryl streep was a 50 year old who wasn’t trying to be a 20 year old but emracing such unadulterated joy and youth in her age that it felt so refreshening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it was wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know this can be tricky and more verbose than uploading your Jekyll site directly to your repository. However GitHub Pages support static HTML pages, a workaround solution for using Almace Scaffolding on GitHub Pages is treating your Jekyll site as static pages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Build your site locally (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;grunt build&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Upload Jekyll generated static files to your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;username.github.io&lt;/code&gt; repository.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to keep all things under Git control, you can try the following file structure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;├── _amsf/ (Almace Scaffolding source code)
├── *.html (Jekyll-generated static pages)
└── README.md (your own readme)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the little debbie murders has an interesting ring to it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we were greeted by a list of rules and regulations and the stakes are high because we are on borrowed land and they were worried that their license might actually be revoked because they were causing quite a ruckus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i think arabs and pakistanis are loud by culture, is that racist to say? it’s not meant to be condescending but it’s just part of their culture. ???&lt;/p&gt;
