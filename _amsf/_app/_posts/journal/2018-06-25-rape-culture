when men read rape stories, they disassociate themselves from the sexual predator. "I don't go aorund raping girls" they say, and while that might be true, but every women who reads the same stroies will always have undeniable fear in their hearts because those victims could literally be anyone. 

You can blame it on the clothes, on the rejection, the circumstance, the weak male self control whatever. In the end it all comes down to literally two reasons: because we are women and they are men. 

So fuck off with your "Not all men", when men has always been the worst kind of human beings to roam on earth. fucking scum.
