I watched Mamma Mia for the first time and wow was I missing out on a masterpiece. 

It wasn't necessarily something I usually indulge in but it made me feel so happy. weirdly so. 

I read an article on it on how https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/nov/27/women and it explained so much on how mamma mia was engineered to be a feel good movie. 

for one thing, it didn't over sexualize the female characters. Amanda Seyfried always was in a one-piece bathing suit and the other characters were so comfortable with their own promiscuity and it was catering towards the female gaze. it is the male charcters that look dumb and stupid.

```
It was very interesting to see the film get totally panned by male critics, but they just didn't understand it. In any other film, the 20-year-old female character would have been Pierce Brosnan's love interest, but in Mamma Mia! there's no hint of sexual tension between them. And when you know that's not going to happen, you relax.

it's something so subconcious that i didn't know it bothered me before, but having the cast presented in a way that was so young and wild and free. and meryl streep worked wonderously as someone embracing her youth embodied in a body her age. it felt so fresh. to see these three middle aged women just owning their bodies and freedom and being dancing queens prancing around chaing guys and being promiscuous with no judgement, but purely from their frivolity and not for the male gaze.

meryl streep was a 50 year old who wasn't trying to be a 20 year old but emracing such unadulterated joy and youth in her age that it felt so refreshening. 

it was wonderful.
