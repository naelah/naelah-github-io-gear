## The Problem

back in my Creative Thinking class in University, we were discussing about rules and morals and civilization, and the instructer told us a scenario, imagine two guys on an island, with no rules, no government, and nothing to lose, what's the most effective way that could stop the other guy from killing him? And we were silent for awhile, he looked at me trying to will the answer out of me somehow but I couldn't make the conenction, what do you do? Make an agreement? Make him his friend? 

And after a while, after the instructor gave up of trying to get us to say it, and as he said it, it occured to me, "You kill the other guy first."

That's survival instinct. you kill or be killed. of course. all the zombie apocalypse shows has trained me to this situation, the fact that I couldn't answer it made me feel ashamed and like I disappointed them somehow.

back to interning, there was something that happened that there was a mix in task assignments, and some of us wouldn't get tasks related to our field which, for me was very alarming because I was concerned about the report and what will I write in it if I spend 6 months sending cheques, answering the phone and making coffee for everyone? And as I told my concern, my boss at the time told us a scenario, the three of us running in the woods and a bear is chasing us. What is the best chance for your survival? And it took me awhile to relate it back to my critical thinking class of the two guys stuck in an island with intents of murder in between them, but I did and reluctantly I said, "Let the bear eat the others." and my boss laughs, "and that's why you have nothing to worry about."

of course the definition of survival and what it takes to survive has evolved throughout time but the essence of it has always been brutal and unforgiving.
