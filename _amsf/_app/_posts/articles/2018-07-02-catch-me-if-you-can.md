i hated catch me if you can. there i said it. despite dicaprio's charming blue eyes, and spielberg's storytelling, and this somewhat witty character people can't help but to fall in love, it brims me with anger. 

first of all, a lot of this was a political statement. this was the 60's, Nixon's era. White supremacy is at its supreme. 60% of why frank got away with things were because he was white. that's just part of the narrative that they forgot to mention. he was a white male in a pilot uniform. what can go wrong?

but you know what angered me the most was that he learnt scamming from his father. his dad who let him skip school so he could accompany him to the bank. it made it sound so important that he needed to harrass a clothing store employee to rent him a suit for his son that was totally unnecessary. his father lied through his teeth to get what he wants. and that set an example to frank jr. on how the world worked and that doesn't sit well to me. that this 16 year old kid who felt that the mouse that churned butter meant scamming through the world. 

you know why this angers me so much? the fact that he doesn't even think of the consequence. of the money he laundered, of the lives he risked impersonating professions that deals with people's lives. 

this was nixon's era, this was the start of the war on drugs. minority communities have been cirminalized and been sent to jail and this punk ass mo fo is getting away doing far worse a crime? forging checks and forging identities. throughout the movie we don't see any blacks, except for this one poor kid who was in deep pain and his legs snapped to two (probably? idk the movie never properly diagnosed him apart from an intern's unsure diagnosis) and his fate is left to this idiot who forged a harvard cert and medical education lmitied to medically inaccurate dramas in the 60's I mean how unlucky can you be? That you're in a life and death situation and your fate is in the hands of a freaking fraud? the movie didn't show what happened to that kid but I am pretty sure that he died. 

and this whole narrative of "oh dad i'll get back the money you lost, i will avenge you." like what money? the money he got from tax evasions? the money he got from lying and cheating? How entitled can you be that you felt that you are entitled for luxury. this is a problem with riches when they fall to rags, they have NO idea how to live an honest life as a middle to lower-class citizen. They have no idea the struggles of people trying to make an honest living, and I am suppoed to like this guy?
