Often women and men don't see eye to eye and there is a whole industry that feeds off of this difference and people interested in it. 

male brains are simple. It's like the most basic turing machine. 

male like sex
male want sex with pretty women
if male want sex women
then women is  attractive

so the justification that catcalling is a compliment. telling someone to smile more is a compliment. random massages in the office is a compliment. firting is a compliment. 

but women's brain are complex. and this is often the butt of a joke, when men say it, it's always with a roll of the eye. it's always the punchline. 
women are so0o0o complicated. it's a cheap way to rouse up women. to inflict a reaction. it is childish and primal to gain one's attention without being based on any facts. 
that having a complex way of thinking is somehow bad?

the thing why men and women could hardly land on the same page is because we're reading different books at different paces, and some lacking the vocabulary to understand the book anyway.
you see, men have different definitions of things than women. 
ask 10 pair or men and women the definition to cheating, the the 5 men would differ contrastly with the women. 

so women try to use more words to make men understand. but the more words we use, the louder voices we get, the crazier we seem. 
and this crazy is implanted in society's view as the default state of women. if a woman gets crazy, it's not your fault they say, they're just like that. They're Complicated!
